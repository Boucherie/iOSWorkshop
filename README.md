We presented this workshop live on January 30th to Women Who Code and have created the Step By Step guide to help participants finish part 3. 

### Workshop Parts
The workshop code has been split into 3 parts. Each part builds on the previous one and can be used to help with fixing bugs along the way. 

### Data
For this project we will be using data from the **Itunes API**. we have including 2 ways to retrieve data in the Networking.swift file. For the workshop specifically we will be using a slighly modified JSON stub from the Itnues API because we do not have enough time to cover it completely. We have included the live networking in a commented out function within that file which can be used to extend the project. Â
